// The file "Alt7ixDih8sConj" contains a set of representatives for the classes of D_1, D_2 and D_3 in E_8(3)'s adjoint representation, inside the permutation representation of S given by phi

//The file "Alt7D3FNormOrbitCycleStructures" contains cycle structures for the orbit representatives of the conjugacy class of s in the normalizer F under its centralizer, when viewed in the radical quotient of the normalizer of F. "Alt7D1D2FNormOrbitCycleStructures" is an analogous file in the D1,D2 case.

// The file "Alt7ixConj" contains a set of representatives for eight subgroups of E_8(3) in its adjoint representation which are isomorphic to Alt(7) and follow feasible decomposition (ix) on V_248.
